**Mock app of  GarageBand**

I used the library [Wavesurfer.js](https://wavesurfer-js.org/) to generate the different soundtracks, and the inherent methods to play, pause, stop the soundtracks.

You can change the volume, solo and mute each track.  
**You can't solo multiple tracks.**

You can choose between 4 different styles: Rock, Blues, Funk and Jazz.

I recorded every instrument for each style by myself.

### How to use the app 
***

Open the index.html file with the LiveServer extension (in VSCode) or any similar extension.

Click on ![help_icon](./assets/image/help_outline_black.svg) to show the keyboard shortcuts and on ![source_icon](./assets/image/source_black.svg) to change the current style.
